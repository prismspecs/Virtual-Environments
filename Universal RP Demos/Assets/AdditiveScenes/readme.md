# Additive Scenes

I will update this page later

The basic idea is to drag scenes from the Project view to the Hierarchy. You can have multiple scenes loaded over one another simultaneously. This is very heplful when working collaboratively, so you don't get merge errors. All teammates work in separate scenes and you combine as needed.
